However, **passing these sanity checks does not mean your code is correct!** During grading we may run your code on additional inputs, and we may look at your code to make sure you've followed the specific guildelines for each implementation.

Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network\n\nIn PyTorch, a neural network is defined as a Python class. It needs to have two methods:\n\n- `__init__()` which initializes the layers used in the network\n- `forward()` which defines how the network performs a forward pass\n\nPyTorch will then automatically generate a `backward()` method that computes the gradients based on the computation done in the forward pass.\n\nAll the [neural network building blocks defined in PyTorch can be found in the torch.nn documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html).\n\nWe use `nn.Sequential` to more easily create a simple sequental neural network:\n\n- First we need to \"flatten\" the 2D image into a vector with `nn.Flatten`\n\n- Next a fully-connected layer with 20 neurons is created with `nn.Linear`. Note that we need to specify the number of input and output connections. In this case there are 28x28=784 inputs, and 64 outputs\n\n- Next, a ReLU non-linear activation\n\n- Finally the output of the last layer needs to be a 10-dimensional vector to match the ground truth of ten classes (the ten digits).\n\nThe output of the last layer should be normalized with softmax, but this is actually included implicitly in the loss function in PyTorch.","metadata":{"pycharm":{"name":"#%% md\n"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class SimpleMLP(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        #############################################################################\n        #                    TODO: Implement this section                           #\n        #############################################################################\n        # Replace \"pass\" statement with your code\n        super().__init__()\n        self.network = nn.Sequential(\n            nn.Flatten(),\n            nn.Linear(784, 64),\n            nn.ReLU(),\n            nn.Linear(64, 10)\n        )\n        #############################################################################\n        #                            END OF YOUR CODE                               #\n        #############################################################################\n\n\n    def forward(self, x):\n        #############################################################################\n        #                    TODO: Implement this section                           #\n        #############################################################################\n        # Replace \"pass\" statement with your code\n        return self.network(x)\n        #############################################################################\n        #                            END OF YOUR CODE                               #\n        #############################################################################\n\ndevice = torch.device(\"cuda\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\")\nmodel = SimpleMLP().to(device)\nprint(model)","metadata":{"pycharm":{"name":"#%%\n"},"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-03-14T16:16:45.778901Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-03-14T16:16:45.779288Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-03-14T16:16:45.827169Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-03-14T16:16:45.779260Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-03-14T16:16:45.826189Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":70,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"SimpleMLP(\n  (network): Sequential(\n    (0): Flatten(start_dim=1, end_dim=-1)\n    (1): Linear(in_features=784, out_features=64, bias=True)\n    (2): ReLU()\n    (3): Linear(in_features=64, out_features=10, bias=True)\n  )\n)\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Training the model\n\nIn order to train the model we need to define a loss function and an optimizer.\n\nFor a classification task we typically use the cross entropy loss.
